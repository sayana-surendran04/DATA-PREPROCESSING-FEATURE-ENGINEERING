MINI PROJECT 1
Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering

1. Data Collection:
•	Choose a Dataset:
o	Visit a reliable dataset repository such as Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, or another trusted source.
o	Choose a dataset that contains a mix of numerical and categorical features. Ensure that it is suitable for a machine learning task (classification, regression, etc.).

2. Data Inspection:
•	Overview:
o	Load the dataset and provide an overview including:
	The number of samples (rows) and features (columns).
	The target variable (if applicable).
o	Initial Observations:
	Look for any obvious issues such as missing values, imbalanced classes, or unusual distributions.
	Mention any challenges you anticipate during preprocessing.

3. Data Preprocessing:
•	Data Cleaning:
o	Missing Values:
	Identify missing values in the dataset.
	Choose an appropriate method to handle missing data (e.g., imputation, deletion, or using models to predict missing values).
	Explain why you chose this method.
•	Feature Scaling:
o	Normalization:
	Apply feature scaling to the numerical features using techniques such as Standardization (z-score normalization) or Min-Max scaling.
	Explain the rationale behind choosing the scaling method.
•	Handling Categorical Data:
o	Encoding:
	Encode categorical variables using techniques such as One-Hot Encoding or Label Encoding.
	Explain your choice of encoding method and how it helps the model to interpret categorical features.

4. Feature Engineering:
•	Create New Features:
o	Apply at least two feature engineering techniques. Examples include:
	Polynomial features, interaction terms, binning continuous variables, or domain-specific features.
	Explain the logic behind each technique and how it improves the dataset's ability to represent the underlying patterns.

5. Handling Imbalanced Data:
•	Addressing Imbalance:
o	If applicable, address class imbalance in the target variable using techniques like oversampling, undersampling, or SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique).
o	Describe the method used and justify why it was chosen.

6. Data Transformation:
•	Save Preprocessed Data:
o	After completing the preprocessing and feature engineering steps, save the cleaned and transformed dataset as a CSV file.
o	Include a link or attachment to this CSV file in your submission.

7. Analysis:
•	Visualizations and Summary Statistics:
o	Provide visualizations (e.g., histograms, box plots, correlation matrices) to illustrate the effects of your preprocessing and feature engineering steps.
o	Include summary statistics before and after preprocessing.
o	Discuss how these steps have improved the dataset’s readiness for machine learning.

8. Conclusion:
•	Summarize Key Takeaways:
o	Reflect on the importance of each step in the preprocessing and feature engineering process.
o	Highlight how these techniques contribute to building effective machine learning models.

9. Submission Guidelines:
•	Code

# Load the dataset

data.columns = columns

# Handle missing values
imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy="most_frequent")
data["occupation"] = imputer.fit_transform(data["occupation"].values.reshape(-1, 1))
data["native-country"] = imputer.fit_transform(data["native-country"].values.reshape(-1, 1))

# Feature scaling
scaler = StandardScaler()
data[["age", "fnlwgt", "education-num", "capital-gain", "capital-loss", "hours-per-week"]] = scaler.fit_transform(data[["age", "fnlwgt", "education-num", "capital-gain", "capital-loss", "hours-per-week"]])

# Encode categorical features
le = LabelEncoder()
data["workclass"] = le.fit_transform(data["workclass"])
data["marital-status"] = le.fit_transform(data["marital-status"])
data["relationship"] = le.fit_transform(data["relationship"])
data["race"] = le.fit_transform(data["race"])
data["sex"] = le.fit_transform(data["sex"])

# One-hot encode remaining categorical features
ohe = OneHotEncoder(sparse=False)
encoded_features = ohe.fit_transform(data[["education", "occupation", "native-country"]])
data = data.drop(["education", "occupation", "native-country"], axis=1)
data = pd.concat([data, pd.DataFrame(encoded_features, columns=ohe.get_feature_names_out())], axis=1)

# Feature engineering
data["age_bin"] = pd.cut(data["age"], bins=[0, 18, 30, 45, 60, 100], labels=["0-18", "19-30", "31-45", "46-60", "61+"])
data["education_occupation"] = data["education"] + "_" + data["occupation"]

# Handle class imbalance
X = data.drop("income", axis=1)
y = data["income"]
smote = SMOTE(random_state=42)
X_resampled, y_resampled = smote.fit_resample(X, y)

# Save the preprocessed dataset
X_resampled.to_csv("preprocessed_adult_income.csv", index=False)
